@@ hi, i'm rayne! @@

  i'm a passionate teenage fullstack node.js/web developer that loves learning new things and expanding their
knowledge. i've been programming since i was a young child and have been working hard at my craft for eight
years. i have six years of experience in web development specifically. in more recent times, i've become
fascinated with and inspired by computer terminals, which were also the inspiration for this README. i've also
gotten into more backend-focused stuff recently.
